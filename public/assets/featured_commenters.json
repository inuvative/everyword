    "comments": "Luke 1:27-38\n\nThis is the beautiful Biblical passage in which Mary says to the angel Gabriel \"Let it be.\"\n\nThis \"Let it be\" is perhaps the heart of the Christmas invitation to us. How will we let ourselves be converted, changed, and matured by the once-again spoken voice of the angel coming to us? What is the Holy Spirit inviting us to conceive and carry as a response to God's divine action? What might be the new opening in our lives that will move us forward into greater communion with the Spirit?\n\nRichard Rohr, in his book Falling Upward, writes about \"first half\" and \"second half\" lives. In our \"first half\" life, we tend to be - and need to be! - dedicated to establishing ourselves, figuring out how we're going to show up in the world, how we're going to make a difference, what the rules of our road are going to be. This is often the time of finding a life partner, finding work, becoming \"someone.\" It is good work. But it is also ego work. It is work that \"builds me,\" even when I am striving to live in the Spirit of Christ.\n\nRohr suggests that at some point, if we want to remain responsive to the call of the Spirit - to our \"angel Gabriels\" - we will gradually move into a an approach that far more says \"let it be\" instead of \"this is me,\" even the good \"this is me\" of young faith. As we pray and respond in the mode of \"let it be\" our hearts broaden and deepen to more closely conform to the dimensions of God's love and compassion. This love and compassion is so deep and wide that our hearts will inevitably be broken open by the extent of it. We become people who understand more and more how it is that love is the \"greatest of these\" (I Corinthians 13) and how immense - infinite! - is this love for all people, including our family, friends, and even enemies. The breaking open means that this involves suffering and work and pain. But it is true heart-work, and that means that in the midst of it all, we will find joy. Ours will be the gift of new whole-heartedness, the heart that has broken for the sake of love becomes a greater heart-made-whole and that new heart has enormous capacity for joy.\n\nYoung Mary somehow finds her way to the \"Let it be\" in her early years. What an astonishing thing it is to be able to say \"let it be\" wholeheartedly at any age. When we do, we will find that all the world has changed, the the Spirit of Christ is expressed in new ways, and our world is made a bit more whole. We will find ourselves sitting in wonder, as Mary did, \"treasuring all this in her heart."

Protection \n\nThese are the dramatic events that usher in the New Testament.  The Son of God is brought into the world in the midst of danger. Danger of isolation and abandonment because of the circumstances of his birth. Danger of murder from an insanely jealous king. But God knows how to choose His caretakers. God chose the right man to raise His Son.\n\nGod chose Joseph. \n\nBetrothed to Mary, and bewildered by her pregnancy, Joseph had every right to divorce her. In fact, in 1st Century Palestine among the religious community, Joseph had an obligation to divorce her. [Betrothed couples were considered as committed as married couples and a formal divorce was required to separate them.] And Joseph, although resigned to divorce her, started to do so quietly in order to minimize her shame. From start to finish we see in this man the highest quality and character; that which we all ought to emulate. But Joseph, in all his self restraint and godliness, still needed a revelation, a dream from God to go the right, but counterintuitive path. \n\nWith every decision and action of Joseph we see a man who chooses to obey the word of God to Him. This is what makes him a great man. A man in whom resides humility, who’ll do what the Lord teaches despite the personal embarrassment it may cause. \n\n“When Joseph awoke from sleep he did what the angel of the Lord told him. He took his wife, but did not have marital relations with her until she gave birth to a son, whom he named Jesus.” Matthew 1:24 & 25.\n\nJoseph, because of his ready obedience, was able to give the Messiah a healthy home; saved His life on more than one occasion, and became the safe harbor that Mary could thrive in as she raised her children. \n\nAnd Joseph had the privilege to name Him… Jesus, Savior.\n\nJoseph had a heart set to obey. \n\nHis was the kind of obedience that said yes to God before the request by God was given. Like Joseph, you and I can become the steward of God’s miracles if we also have said \"yes” to God before He even asks anything of us. \n\nJust say yes…to God."

    "comments": "The story of Joseph and Mary traveling 90 miles from Nazareth to Bethlehem amazes me. When my wife was in her eighth month of pregnancy with our first child, her back hurt a lot.  She could not get comfortable enough to sleep much. She experienced a lot of downward pressure and knifing pains as her body prepared for what was ahead.  She tended to overheat easily, and she was very tired.  I had taken the bar exam in Colorado, and we needed to travel back to Utah for a one year clerkship. We visited the doctor and he was concerned that we would be traveling close to her due date. He suggested that we might want to have my wife fly a couple of weeks before me and then I drive and join her there.  But my wife said “NO” emphatically. She was not willing to risk going into early labor and delivering the baby without me there. I’m not sure why, because, as it turned out, I was completely useless in the delivery room. But we did not know that at the time.  \n\nSo, we loaded up our tiny two-door hatchback Honda Civic with all of our worldly belongings, including the waterbed frame and mattress on a rack on top of the car.  I tried to make her as comfortable as possible with pillows for the day of travel.  Since we did not have air conditioning, we brought a spray mist bottle to keep her cool.  With our Beverly Hillbilly-type load, we maxed out at around 50 mph driving up into the mountains on I-70.\n\nThat is something I remember when I think of what Mary and Joseph's trip must have been like. “And Joseph also went up from Galilee, ...unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem; ... To be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child” (Luke 2:4–5). Only a life or death mandate from the cruel rulers of the land could have forced Mary and Joseph to make this grueling trip during the last days of Mary’s pregnancy. \n\nThe last leg of Joseph and Mary’s 90-mile journey from Nazareth--the 3,500 foot climb in elevation from Jericho to Bethlehem--must have been brutal for a woman about to deliver. Imagine the couple traveling slowly and painfully, resting often in an effort to ease Mary’s discomfort. They finally arrive late in the day to find the wayside inn packed to the bursting point with travelers. It is busy, crowded, noisy. No room for more. \n\nSurely someone must have noticed the forlorn young couple in dire distress. But the inn-crowd was tired and had their own worries. Perhaps some had left early that morning so they could claim a spot to relax and rest comfortably. I suppose it is understandable that no one made room for the exhausted, anxious couple, but what if someone had? The Christmas narrative would read something like this: \n\n“And Simeon of Tarsus gave up his room for Joseph and Mary, fetched a midwife, heated and carried warm water, borrowed a cradle, and attended to their needs. And Mary brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a cradle; because Simeon made room for them in the inn.”\n\nSimeon would have been among the first to witness the arrival of the Christ child. Such sacred joy! His deeds of kindness would be celebrated and recounted every year by billions of Christians around the world. The story of Joseph and Mary arriving at Bethlehem would glorify the goodness humanity rather than illustrating its selfish tendencies. \n\nI do not really believe that Christ’s birth should have been different.  It is somehow fitting that our Savior was born in a lonely place of filth, since he came to willingly carry our filth, and selfishness and sorrows.  \n\nBut still I ask “What if?”  “What if someone made room for the Savior?” \n\n“What if?”"

    "comments": "Matthew 1:20-24\n\nIsn’t trust a wonderful thing?  To believe somebody or to have confidence in the words of another is a great thing.  It is a wonderful experience to have a heart that can lean upon another.  It is even a fuller experience to have such a heart toward the things which God says. \n\nThat is what we see in the Christmas account.  Certainly we see it with Mary, the mother of Jesus.  Though facing uncertainty from being pregnant, miraculously, she still accepted God’s plan for her.  Elizabeth says to Mary, “Blessed is she who has believed what the Lord has said to her will be accomplished.”  (Luke 1:45)  After the shepherds spoke about this Child, we read, “Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart.”  (Luke 2:19)  And, of course, the great verse in Luke 1, after Gabriel came to her with the news of this birth, “I am the Lord’s servant.  May it be to me as you have said.”  (Verse 38)\n\nBut trust doesn’t come so easily.  Sometimes peaceful trust is first met with great apprehension and fear.  You can you see it in Mary, “How will this be since I am a virgin?”  (Luke 1:34)  I think we can say the same about Joseph.  In our verses in Matthew 1 the bewilderment of hearing that the woman he was engaged to was pregnant was troubling.  He thought he knew her.  He thought he knew her family.  He thought he knew her morals.  But he must have misjudged!!  \n\n“Because Joseph, her husband was a righteous man and did not want to expose her to public disgrace, he had in mind to divorce her quietly.”  (Matthew 1:19)  He could have been legalistic – a public stoning was in order.  She was pregnant.  He knew, though she was engaged to him, that he had not fathered the child.  But his plan was to break the engagement, quietly and quickly, and move on with life.  But once again God intervenes.  Dr. Jeff Gibbs is his commentary on Matthew says, “Joseph is, for all the right reasons, about to do the wrong thing, but God intervenes.”\n\nJoseph is told about this great event.  The pregnancy came by way of a miracle through the work of the Holy Spirit.  The Child was not just an ordinary gift from heaven, this child was Jesus, the one who would save people from the death of sin.  The miraculous incarnation wasn’t the only miracle that would make one shake their head, but the fact that this little child would be Immanuel – God with us.\n\nJoseph, for the right reasons ready to do the wrong thing, would do the right thing for the right reasons.  “When Joseph woke up, he did what the angel of the Lord commanded him and took Mary home as his wife.”  (Matthew 1:24)  He trusted God’s word.  He relied upon what God’s angel told him.  He believed that God was sending the Savior, and that child was the promised one – Immanuel – God with us.     \n\nDo you find it easy to trust God?  Can you rely on Him during every hard time, every dark moment?  Do you carry guilt over sins that you have committed, finding it impossible to believe that God could forgive you fully and forever?  Do you face eternity with apprehension because you aren’t sure that heaven will be your home?\n\nIf that is you, then Christmas, the sending of Christ, is for you.  God intervenes.  Isn’t that what we see with Mary and Joseph?  Both are confused and don’t know what this all means, but God intervenes and says that all this is God’s plan.  God is still intervening.  He can take us from despair to hope; from sin to forgiveness; from hell to heaven.  \n\nThis Christmas may you discover that trust in Jesus and His promises makes for the best Christmas ever!!"

    "comments": "Unlikely Christmas Cards\n\nIf you ask most any woman the story of her child’s entry into the world, particularly her first born, you should be prepared for all of the details. Rarely, do I hear a parent tell something as simple as, “I gave birth, wrapped him up, and put him in the crib.” When we read THE birth story, of the Christ child, we do not hear the details of the birth, but we do get details of the larger story. We hear about the travelling from Galilee to Bethlehem. We hear about the angels announcing what was going to happen and what did happen. We hear about the shepherds, and the visitors from the east. These are the images that adorn our mantels, our Christmas cards, our sanctuaries, even some of our yards. If some great card company decided to market a scented version or a scratch and sniff (is that still a thing?) Christmas card, it would surely represent the lovely scents on the season – pine, spruce, gingerbread, cinnamon. No company would want to share what was probably overwhelming the air as Mary lifted her face away from the scent of newness she cradled in her arms. It was the smell of animals, a stable, a cave – dust… and straw …and animal… and worse.\n\nWhen we clean up and polish the image of the birth of the king into pretty pictures and beautiful figurines, we allow ourselves to miss the reality that this was an amazing story of an unlikely mother giving birth to the Lord of All in the midst of the place where the animals were kept. God saw fit to come to us in this way, “And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.” (Luke 2:7) This story of the birth of Jesus reminds us once again of the God who works in unusual and unexpected ways. This is the One who takes the common and makes it holy, even as common as a feed trough for animals, becomes the sacred spot in which the Lord of All first lays his head. God still works in the common and ordinary of our lives and creates holy and sacred places. As we celebrate  the season of expectation and waiting, I pray we will be looking for the places in our lives and in our world where God is still making unlikely things holy – including you and me.\n\nReverend Liz Roberts\n\nPastor, Fairmont UMC"

    "comments": "Shepherds \n(Luke 2:8-20, NRSV)\n\n\tThe newborn babe is lying in a manger wrapped in swaddling cloth and it is now time to announce this wondrous event to the world.  As Luke tells the story, it is “shepherds living out in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night” (2:8) who receive this glorious proclamation.  Shepherds, those whose profession places them on the margins of society are called to witness the divine revelation of God’s reconciliation with humanity and to spread the word as the first evangelists.  \n\t\nWhy are shepherds the first to be called?  The shepherd is a familiar figure in Hebrew Scriptures.  Shepherds, like Moses and David are called to serve God in extraordinary ways as shepherds of God’s people. The prophets, like Jeremiah and Ezekiel, use the example of the unscrupulous shepherd to warn Israel that it is being falsely governed and assure the people that God will ultimately come to shepherd them.  God will deliver God’s people through a Good Shepherd, the title that Jesus embraces for himself in his ministry.  It is thus fitting that it is to good shepherds, those who are actively watching their flock at night that God sends his messenger to declare that God is present and has sent a Savior, a Messiah, a Lord to “all the people.” (2:10) \n\nDear Lord, Let us be as the shepherds in the fields, filled with wonder and awe in the presence of your heavenly host and open to your message of peace and hope. Fill us with the faith and hope we witnessed as the shepherds hastened to meet the Savior, Messiah and Lord. And help us continue to go forth glorifying and praising you as we share the Good News, the arrival of a Good Shepherd the One you sent to lead all of your people. \n\nAmen"

    "comments": "DECEMBER 19th: THE MAGI / WISE MEN \n\n“ 9 After this I looked, and there before me was a great multitude that no one could count, from every nation, tribe, people and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb. They were wearing white robes and were holding palm branches in their hands. 10 And they cried out in a loud voice: ‘Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb’” (Revelation 7:9-10).\n \nAt the end of time, we are told that the nations will gather around the throne and worship the One who is King of all. Not one people group on the face of the earth will be unrepresented. This is because the King of Kings deserves worship from all peoples, and He will surely receive the glory due His name (Psalm 96:8).\n \nA little over 2,000 years ago, in the small town of Bethlehem, the Bible provides us with a foretaste of the gathering of the nations worshipping the King, King Jesus Magi from the east followed a star that led them towards Jerusalem, where they were headed to find the child who was the “King of the Jews.” Magi, or “wise men” as some translations put it, were men from the east, probably of very noble families. We learn from the book of Daniel that in earlier days, magi were people within the Babylonian and Persian empires who were priests and experts in mysteries. They studied the stars, took part in astrology, and were known for their wisdom in interpreting dreams. The magi were sinners, considered “unclean” before God, because they took part in practices that God had forbidden. All of us can relate to this, as we have all done things that separate us from God, go against His will, and leave us standing “unclean.”\n \nYet, there is hope in Jesus. Despite the fact that the magi were pagans and sinners, the second chapter of Matthew tells us that these magi traveled a long way in order to find this Child. The magi clearly knew that the Child they were going to see was more than just the King of the Jews. They were coming to worship One who they recognized as the King of the nations. “When they saw the star, they were overjoyed. On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh (Matt. 2:10-11). Just like the magi recognized Jesus for who He is, bowing down and worshipping Him, we too must recognize who Jesus really is. Even as sinners, however far from Him we may be, from whichever people, language, or nation- we can come bow to Jesus.\n \nAs it was around 2,000 years ago, it is the same today- wise men are still those who worship Jesus as King."

    "comments": "Isaiah 61 Meditation\n \n            Recently I started a book by Moustafa Bayoumi called How Does It Feel to Be a Problem: Being Arab in America.  In this book Bayoumi shares stories from seven young Arab Americans in a post-9/11 world.  In one of the stories, Rasha, an immigrant college student was arrested shortly after 9/11 with her whole family just for being an Arab immigrant.  She and her family were split up into different prison systems and spent a total of six months behind bars simply because of where they were born.  Rasha and her family were not alone in this.  Hundreds of Arab people were detained for indeterminate times after 9/11 as suspected terrorists just because of their countries of origin.\n \n            Stories like Rasha’s make me think about Isaiah 61 where it says: “He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim freedom for the captives and release from darkness for the prisoners…”  In another time in our history when there is extreme fear from the immigrant community with the change of leadership in Washington, this Bible verse brings me hope for the world.   As we worry for the communities that may be affected by new laws and regulations contrary to what Jesus taught, how can we be working to free the captives in our own neighborhoods?  How can we give a reprieve in darkness for those struggling around us in our everyday lives?  Is there an organization around where you live that is fighting for freedom for the oppressed?  Could you give of your time and talents to these organizations?\n \nPrayer: Dearest Heavenly Father, grant me wisdom and compassion to look after my neighbors, particularly those who don’t look like me and don’t believe the same things that I do.  Bless those who feel captive or brokenhearted this holiday season and give them the peace and rest that comes into the world through your son Jesus.  Amen."
